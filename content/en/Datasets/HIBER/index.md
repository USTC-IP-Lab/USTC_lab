[HIBER (Human Indoor Behavior Exclusive RF dataset)](https://github.com/Intelligent-Perception-Lab/HIBER?tab=readme-ov-file) is an open-source mmWave human behavior recognition dataset collected from multiple domains(i.e., various environments, users, occlusionsï¼Œand actions). It can be used to study human position tracking, human behavior recognition, human pose estimation, and human silhouette generation tasks. The total size of the processed dataset is 400GB, including RF heatmaps, RGB images, 2D/3D human skeletons, bounding boxes, and human silhouette ground truth.
