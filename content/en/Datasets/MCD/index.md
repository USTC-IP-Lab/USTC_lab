[MCD-Gesture](https://github.com/leeyadong/cross_domain_gesture_dataset) is a cross-domain gesture dataset consisting of 24050 instances from 25 users, 6 environments, and 5 locations. MCD-Gesture is collected from various domains (i.e. environments, users, and locations), and it can be used to develop mmWave gesture recognition systems and domain-independent machine learning algorithms.
