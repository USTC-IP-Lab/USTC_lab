[H-WILD](https://github.com/H-WILD/human_held_device_wifi_indoor_localization_dataset) is a human-held device WiFi localization dataset consisting of 120,000 frames from 10 volunteers across 4 rooms. We collect datasets in four typical indoor scenarios: conference, laboratory, office, and lounge. During data collection, volunteers are instructed to walk freely around the room while holding the transmitter in their hands. They can walk slowly, walk quickly, or stop, just as they normally would do during their daily activities. And we use an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) based localization system with an accuracy of ten of centimeters to collect ground truth location data.
